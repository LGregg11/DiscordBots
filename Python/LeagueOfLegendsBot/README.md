# League of Legends Bot

## Ideas for the bot
1. Ask for player rank and points
2. Ask for general player info
3. Ask for most played champs etc
4. Ask for player win rate

### How to develop locally
1. Create a 'LeagueOfLegendsAPI.json' file
5. Store the LOL API details in the LeagueOfLegendsAPI.json file as follows:
{
    "APIKEY": \<ApiKey\>
}

Note: Don't commit this json file..!
